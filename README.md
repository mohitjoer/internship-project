# 🛠 Complaint Management System

A simple but powerful **full-stack web app** where users can submit complaints and admins can manage them.  
Built with **Next.js (TypeScript)**, **MongoDB**,**shadcn/ui**, and **Nodemailer**, it's designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to use.

## ✨ What This App Does

  - Title
  - Description
  - Category (Product / Service / Support)
  - Priority (Low / Medium / High)

- The admin instantly gets an email notification about the new complaint

### 🛡 For Admins:

- Filter by **status** or **priority**
- Change the status to:
  - Pending
  - In Progress
  - Resolved
- Delete complaints with one click
- Receive **email confirmations** when status changes to Resolved

## 📧 Setting up Gmail App Password (Important!)

Gmail doesn't allow you to log in with your normal password in apps like Nodemailer. You need to create a Google App Password instead.

### Enable 2-Step Verification:
1. Go to [Google Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Turn on 2-Step Verification

### Generate an App Password:
1. Go to [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. Choose **Mail** as the app
3. Choose **Other** and type "Nodemailer"
4. Click **Generate** and copy the 16-character password

## 📌 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following structure:

```bash
MONGO_DB_API=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
EMAIL_USER=your_email_address_here
EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password_here
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin_email_address_here
```

**Notes:**
